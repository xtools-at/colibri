### Button actions

Some actions require confirmation on the hardware, you'll notice the led start flashing. If your device has two buttons, press _Ok_ to approve or _Cancel_ to reject. If you only have one, _double-click_ to approve or _long-press_ to cancel.

Additionally the following actions can be triggered on the device directly:

- Hold down _Cancel_ to lock your idle wallet. If it's locked already, it will reboot the device instead.
- Quickly press _Cancel_ ten times to trigger a complete wipe of the device.

### LED status

## Wallet setup

tool - supported browser

### set pw

First we need to set a _password_ for our wallet. This is used to encrypt **all** sensitive information, so choosing a secure password is crucial for the security of your device. We recommend using a [Diceware](https://diceware.dmuth.org/) password with at least 3-4 random words.

Next time we want to use our wallet, we'll need to unlock it first:

### add seed

Next we need to generate or add a mnemonic seed phrase to our wallet. Use a **metal seed storage** to back up your seed phrase - we recommend [SAFU Ninja](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/reviews/safu-ninja/) as a cheap and reliable DIY solution.

- no recovery on devices w/o screen -> once in response
