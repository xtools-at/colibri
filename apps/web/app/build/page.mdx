# How to build your own crypto hardware wallet

Colibri doesn't require prior knowledge in hardware, or complicated tooling. It can be built with _Arduino IDE_ only, a beginner-friendly environment to program microcontrollers. Anyone willing to bear with some initial setup and following step-by-step tutorials should be able to create their own hardware wallet quickly.

## What you need

TODO: computer, internet, board from 3-x$, usb cable

## Steps to build

- [Get an ESP32 development board](/build/get-esp32-board)
- [Download and setup Arduino IDE](/build/setup-arduino-ide) (one-time setup)
- [Build and flash the wallet firmware](/build/flash-firmware)

When that's done, head over here to [setup and interact with your wallet](/use/setup#TODO).
