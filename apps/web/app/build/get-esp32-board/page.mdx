# Get an ESP32 development board

Colibri is built to support a wide range of **ESP32** chips and boards, not just specific hardware configurations.

## What does a board need?

The following _Espressif_ chips are supported:

- ESP32 (original)
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-S3

The minimum requirements for your development board are:

- at least one _programmable_ button (RST/EN is not enough)
- one _programmable_ LED (simple, or Neopixel RGB)
- Bluetooth Low Energy support

## Which board to pick?

You can get these boards really cheap on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-esp32-c3.html) (e.g. the [Supermini board](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005006406538478.html) we use in development), or on Amazon for a bit more money.
