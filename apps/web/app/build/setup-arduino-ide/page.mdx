# Setup Arduino IDE

**Arduino IDE** is a beginner-friendly development environment for programming microcontrollers.

## Install and configure Arduino IDE

- [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and [enable support for ESP32 boards](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions). Internally we're using these versions to build:
  - Arduino IDE 2.3.2 (w/ Arduino CLI 0.35.3)
  - `esp32` Arduino Core 3.1.0 (w/ ESP-IDF 5.3)
- Go to `File > Preferences` and enable _"Show files inside sketches"_ and _"Show verbose output during compile"_

## Test your setup

Connect your ESP32 dev board via USB, and change the target board in Arduino IDE to `Tools > Board > esp32 > ESP32XX Dev Module` (where "XX" is your ESP32 chip type).

Also make sure that the USB port your board is connected to is set in `Tools > Port`:

Then try uploading an _empty sketch_ to your board to verify everything is working as it should. Click on `File > New Sketch`, then the `Upload` button:

## Troubleshooting

[Try these](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-troubleshooting-guide) and [these tips](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/troubleshooting-sketches/) in case you're running into any connection issues.

Most common issues:

- Some boards require you to put them in flash mode manually (hold down _BOOT_ button, then press _RST/EN_ button)
- [Wrong port selected](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/troubleshooting-sketches/#board--port) in `Tools > Port`
- [Missing drivers on Windows/macOS](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-troubleshooting-guide/#COM-port-not-found)
- [Missing user group permission on Linux](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016495679-Fix-port-access-on-Linux)
- USB cable doesn't support data transfer (try another cable)
